This is the open repository for work done within the OGC GeoSemantics DWG. 

## GeoSPARQL

This group has been gathering [change requests for GeoSPARQL 2.0](http://ogc.standardstracker.org/requestlist.cgi?quicksearch=geosparql) and has described the benefits of semantic and graph technologies for spatial data in a [white paper](whitepaper-ideas.md), explaining the business reasons, and requirements, for a geographical query language for graphs as well as an accompanying ontology. 

The GeoSPARQL SWG is actively working on updates of the GeoSPARQL standard in a separate [github repository](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc-geosparql). 

The charter: [OGC GeoSPARQL SWG Charter](https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/geosparqlswg)

The white paper: [OGC Benefits of Representing Spatial Data Using Semantic and Graph Technologies](https://github.com/opengeospatial/geosemantics-dwg/blob/master/white_paper/wp.pdf)

## GeoDCAT

An SWG, jointly hosted by the GeoSemantics DWG and the MetaCat DWG, is being set up for the publication of GeoDCAT, GeoDCAT-AP, and other profiles of DCAT to support use of OGC standards.
