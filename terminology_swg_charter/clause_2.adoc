== Business Value Proposition

////
This section provides a statement describing the value of this standards activity in relation to the OGC Membership, the geospatial community, and the wider IT community. This statement can be in terms of the interoperability problem being solved, processing Change requests to meet market (and Member requirements), a policy requirement and/or some other business value proposition. The proposition described in this section does not have to be in economic terms.

=== Value to the OGC
The OGC is faced with many instances where terminology is referenced, and a range of legacy solutions from either developed or adopted standards.  Often these solutions are based on duplication of content such as keywords, without reference to the allowable range of such keywords. Most typically applications of OGC standards face the problem of specifying the terminology needed to achieve semantic interoperability of content, or full description of application specific services.

Having a dedicated SWG to standardise approaches, working in conjunction with other WGs such as the OGC API "umbrella" SWG, the OAB and the Spatial Data on the Web WG allows for solutions to be validated and shared to cover the spectrum of terminology and terminology services approaches.

=== Value to the OGC Membership
A centralised forum to assess and debate solutions to terminology interoperability frees OGC members from the complexities of reviewing a wide range of internal and external implementations. It allows conformance and software support for basic capabilities to be widely understood and implemented.

This SWG represents the principles of "encapsulation" of a complex problem through sharing the simplest possible common solutions.

=== Value to the geospatial community
The larger geospatial community will benefit from an ability to achieve semantic interoperability across the suite of OGC standards implementations, without having to develop specific application solutions for every deployment having potentially different solutions.

=== Value to the wider IT community
This is a problem not solved in the wider IT community - OpenAPI for example has stated a desire to look to OGC for understanding of requirements.  This is natural, since terminology differences are inherent in geography, both in terms of formal jurisdictions and social context.

By demonstrating approaches relevant to OGC standards, which in turn build on wider IT community standards, this SWG can support a "design pattern" approach, or more formal interactions with other specifications.
