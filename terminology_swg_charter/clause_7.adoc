== Domain Working Group Endorsement

This SWG scope addresses requirements for interoperable best practices in across multiple environments.

As terminology is both a semantic and implementation concern, the GeoSemantics DWG should work with relevant SWG implementing functionality to identify requirements and opportunities for standardisation.

_As one or more APIs and profiles of OGC APIs are envisaged the OGC APIs SWG should be engaged, however these activities can be limited to best practices for use of existing OGC APIs and schemas and does not have any impact on legacy standards._
