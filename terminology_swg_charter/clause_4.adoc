== Description of deliverables



=== Initial Deliverables

The initial deliverables are based on the initial selection and prioritization of issues from the OGC Standards Tracker. This selection will be determined in the first meetings of the working group and subsequently updated in this working group charter.

After deciding on the initial issues to be worked on, this SWG will publish a roadmap to be used to manage scope and timeframes for delivery of a modular revision of the GeoDCAT profile standard.


=== Additional SWG Tasks

Additional SWG tasks will be added iteratively when new change requests and issues become apparent or gain priority. The SWG is planned as a long term working group so that new change requests may arise during the development of the initial deliverables. These will be prioritized and periodically classified as additional SWG tasks.
