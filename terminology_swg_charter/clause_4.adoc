== Description of deliverables

- Schema Building Blocks supporting terminology references
- API Building Blocks for augmenting OGC API endpoints with terminology
- Ontology Building Blocks for profiling and extending SKOS to support federation and terminology provenance

Note that these Building Blocks will include canonical resources with persistent URL locations, validation resources, examples and transformation rules with testing.

Profiles of existing OGC standards will be described as Building Blocks supported further profiling and combination using the same mechanisms as profile constraint specifications (i.e. a scalable, reusable solution)

=== Initial Deliverables

The following set of deliverables provides a minimal capability:

- JSON schema for a minimal SKOS profile (using JSON-LD for simple interpretation as SKOS)
- OGC API - Terminology using the minimal SKOS profile JSON schema to serve terminology definitions
- OGC API Records profile constraining references to managed terminology resources, including terminology resource subsets as range of property values
- OGC API Features profile constraining terminology to references to managed terminology resources

After these federation mechanisms for terminology services can be explored in the context of wider IT community directions, using the above mechanisms as driving Use Cases to drive requirements.

=== Additional SWG Tasks

Additional SWG tasks will be added iteratively when new change requests and issues become apparent or gain priority. The SWG is planned as a long term working group so that new change requests may arise during the development of the initial deliverables. These will be prioritized and periodically classified as additional SWG tasks.
