== Domain Working Group Endorsement

This SWG scope addresses requirements for interoperable best practices in both geosemantics and metadata catalogs, and hence will report to both the Geosemantics and Metadata and Catalogs Domain Working Groups (DWGs).

The Chairs of the Geosemantics DWG, Joseph Abhayaratna and Linda van den Brink, and the chairs of the MetaCat DWG, Danny Vandenbrouke and Byron Cochrane, do formally endorse the formation of the GeoDCAT Standards Working Group (SWG).
