# GeoSPARQL

This group has been gathering [change requests for GeoSPARQL 2.0](http://ogc.standardstracker.org/requestlist.cgi?quicksearch=geosparql) and working on a [white paper](whitepaper-ideas.md) explaining the business reasons, and requirements, for a geographical query language for graphs as well as an accompanying ontology. 

We are now working on resurrecting the GeoSPARQL SWG, chartered to work on a new version of GeoSPARQL. 

The draft charter: [OGC GeoSPARQL SWG Charter](https://github.com/opengeospatial/geosemantics-dwg/blob/master/geosparql_2.0_swg_charter/swg_charter.pdf)
