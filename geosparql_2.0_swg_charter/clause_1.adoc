== Purpose of the Standards Working Group

////
Proposers will describe the purpose of the Standards Working Group and its overall mission in relation to OGC processes, the OGC standards baseline, and OGC’s business plan.
////

The purpose of this SWG is to revise, and likely extend, the GeoSPARQL standard.

Its overall mission is to ensure that the features of GeoSPARQL remain up-to-date with the spatial Semantic Web community whose needs now outstrip the current content of GeoSPARQL.

This revision will likely result in a GeoSPARQL 2.0 that will be both backwards-compatible with GeoSPARQL and form a new base Semantic Web standard for geospatial users.
